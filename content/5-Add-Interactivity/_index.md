#### Overview

Welcome to the interactivity section of the workshop. In this section, you will update the website you created in task one to use the Amplify UI component library to scaffold out an entire user authentication flow, allowing users to sign up, sign in, and reset their password and invoke the GraphQL API we created in module three. This will add the ability to display the userâ€™s email that was captured using a serverless function.
